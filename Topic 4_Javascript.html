<h2><i><u>XML Request to Consume JSON data</u></i></h2>
<p class='cdePrgrph'>
    For this topic, we will extract JSON data from a National Park Service API.  The API can be found
    at </p><a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm">NPS API</a><br>
<p class='cdePrgrph'>
    The JSON data contains information on all national parks within the US and this web page will make 
    a call to the data with the data being filtered to display only the park information for the particular
    state that the user would like to have displayed.  The function that makes the call and then displays it 
    for the user to see is assigned to a button.  The first portion creates the new request and is as follows;
</p><br>
<img src="Topic4/images/jsonCall1.PNG" class='cdePic' alt='Code Picture'><br>
<p class="cdePrgrph">
    The first line of code takes a value from the select box.  This value will be used as a filter in the JSON call, to filter for 
    a specific state.  The next line of code creates a variable for the JSON call.  This variable is called parksURL.  Next a 
    new XMLHttpRequest is created.  The parksURL variable is used in the request to retrieve the data.  A second function is then embedded
    within the first.  This second function is as follows;
</p><br>

<p class="cdePrgrph">
    This next function parses the JSON data, stores it in the console log, and then runs a loop to display the information 
    for each of the national parks within the selected state.  Note the if statement.  While creating the code I realized that
    occasionally some states would not display the park information.  I discovered that the reason was because some of the 
    national parks stored information did not have any images, so when I tried to retrieve the URL for an image, the URL was 
    undefined and was stopping rest of the code from running.  So, I included an if statement that would store an image tag with
    the URL if the URL was defined, otherwise I would store '' into the variable.  That variable is then displayed within the code
    that loops through data. Another if statement is used for directions to inform the user that no directions are provided when 
    the JSON data lacks information for the directions. Try the code out below.
