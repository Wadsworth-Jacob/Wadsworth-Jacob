<h2>Object Creation</h2>

<p class="cdePrgrph">
    Objects are variables too, but they can contain multiple data for the particular object.
    Each data point within the object is called a property of the object.  The code below creates an object
    for the Mesa, AZ Temple.
</p><br>

<p class="cdePrgrph">
    Notice from the code that I have embedded variables into my types that are effectively
    embedding both html code and even an image into the the object.  The code below demonstrates
    how this object could then be called and displayed within a DIV tag.  Check out both the code
    below along with the displayed results within the web page.

<h2><i><u>Oject Constructor, Inheritance, Properties, Instantiation, and Methods</u></i></h2>

<p class="cdePrgrph">
    Now lets look at object constructor.  We can create a constructor with a function.  The constructor
    function will help us in our efforts to duplicate several similar objects.  Below is a constructor for an 
    object titled 'temple'.  Note that the object has different data points known as properties and sets them 
    equal to 'this. ...'. 'This' will allow us to use set the new object properties equal to the entries we provide.
    Using 'this.' and (later we will see) using the word new is used for instantiation as we create multiple objects
    based off of the 'temple' object.
</p><br>

<img class="cdePic" src="Wadsworth-Jacob/Topic2/images/templeConstructor.PNG"><br>

<p class="cdePrgrph">
    Note also within the code that there is a property called 'nameHTML'.  This property is assigned to a function, or
    the property is given a method.  We will look more closely at this method and its purpose in a moment. In the 
    mean time, note that the property does not mirror any of the parameters above.  When we create an object using 
    the 'temple' constructor, we will not need to add anything additional for this property; however, each 
    create from the temple constructor will inherit, or receive an inheritance, of this method.<br>
    Now, lets look at the code behind the nameHTML function.
</p><br>

<img class='cdePic' src="Wadsworth-Jacob/Topic2/images/nameHTML.PNG"><br>

<p class="cdePrgrph">
    First, note from the code that two variables are first declared.  These variables are used to make sure
    that the appropriate HTML code is included within the nameHTML property.  Then note how these along with
    the 'name' property and the word ' Temple' are concatenated together.  This is to allow us to be able to
    create a header for each of our objects that will displayed.
</p><br>

<p class="cdePrgrph">
    Now, let's look at the code that runs the function for creating each of the objects.  The first code that you
    will see is code to set variables that will be used to store pictures within each of the objects and then the 
    code that follows is the code that creates the new objects with our constructor function.
</p><br>

<p class="cdePrgrph">
        These objects can also be stored in an array.  Then we can use a function that will call the individual
        objects that are within the array.  Consider the code below that stores the objects into an array and 
        then consider the function that is called every time the select tag is changed.
